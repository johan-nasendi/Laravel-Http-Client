## About Laravel HTTP Client

Laravel provides an expressive, minimal API around the Guzzle HTTP client, allowing you to quickly make outgoing HTTP requests to communicate with other web applications. Laravel's wrapper around Guzzle is focused on its most common use cases and a wonderful developer experience.

Before getting started, you should ensure that you have installed the Guzzle package as a dependency of your application. By default, Laravel automatically includes this dependency. However, if you have previously removed the package, you may install it again via Composer:


## Project setup
```
Git Clone https://github.com/johan-nasendi/Laravel-Http-Client.git
```

### Install vendor composer
```
Composer update
```

### Setup Env
```
create .env & create database
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```

### Run
```
php artisan serve
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/http-client#main-content).


### Run
